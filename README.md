# Graphing-Calculator
An HTML/CSS/JavaScript Graphing Calculator!

Current Master Features:
-Graphing 9 functions simultaniously, and can add more if needed. Only problem is, the runtime gets much slower.
-Graphing the 1st derivative and the 2nd derivative of the functions
-Finding holes and vertical asymtotes
-Changing Domain of x, Range of y, and the xStep/yStep
-Changing the precision of the graphing: lower number = higher precision
-Dragging on the coordinate plane will move the graph over
-A "home" button for a general window for most scenarios and a "trig" button for a trig window.

Currently Developing:
-Writing out the holes and the asymptotes
-Highlighting holes and asymptotes on the graph
